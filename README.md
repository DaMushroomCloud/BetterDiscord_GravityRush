# Gravity Rush theme for Better Discord Software 
This is going to be an ongoing project for a nice UI based on the game Gravity Rush 2. A Gravity Rush 1 variant may make it's way into the future.


I am going to edit an exising set of code but I want to learn where to begin as I am a begginner in CSS. This is just a learning project for when I get to it.
